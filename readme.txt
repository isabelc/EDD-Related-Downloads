Show related downloads by tag or category when using Easy Digital Downloads plugin.

== Description ==

This is an extension for [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) that automatically adds related downloads after the single download content on the single download page. 
It is simple and light. It works by default without a need for any settings. By default, 3 related downloads will be shown, related by download_tag. The title and featured image will be displayed, centered nicely. 

**Unobtrusive Styling - Fits right into your theme**

*   The featured images adopt your theme's style for `.wp-post-image`.
*	You can modify the image style with this selector: `#isa-related-downloads img `
*	Responsive CSS is included so it looks good on any size screen.

**Works automatically. No settings needed.**

This plugin has only 3 settings, and they are optional. These 3 options are located at `Downloads --> Settings --> Misc tab`.
