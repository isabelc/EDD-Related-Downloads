EDD - Related Downloads
=======================

Show related downloads by tag or category when using Easy Digital Downloads plugin.

This is an extension for [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) that automatically adds related downloads after the single download content on the single download page. 
It is simple and light. It works by default without a need for any settings. By default, 3 related downloads will be shown, related by download_tag. The title and featured image will be displayed, centered nicely. The related downloads are added right below the content of the single download.

**Languages**

It includes a `.pot` file so you can easily translate into other languages.
